# Week 12: Assignment 7- Micro:bit I/O

## 1. LED's 
  
  i) The [original.js](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/final-project-assignment-7-week-12-leeanswoo/blob/master/original.js) allows us to use the LED's once they are connected to the correct pins, using the GPIO pins and ground. The video of the functioning program can be found [Here](https://imgur.com/a/exN3I0y) 
  
  

## 2. Soil Sensor 

  i) This program reads the TTL input from the CADET boards and only when the TTL input is a generating a high input. The program can be founnd [Here.](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/final-project-assignment-7-week-12-leeanswoo/blob/master/digital-in.js) The video of the operating program can be found [Here.](https://imgur.com/a/pw2fL6A)
  
  iv) This program will use the the digital input read function to gather data from the sensor to give us a range to use for our index. The video of the [manual-calibration.js](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/final-project-assignment-7-week-12-leeanswoo/blob/master/manual-calibration.js) can be found [Here.](https://imgur.com/a/P8K4EVr)

vi) This program will get the values of each dry and wet reading and get the average of both and enter them as the minimum and maximum for the new map and index for the microbit. The [Auto-calibration.js](https://imgur.com/a/P8K4EVr) video can be found [Here](https://imgur.com/a/HQnfxb1)
