# Week 12: Assignment 7- Micro:bit I/O

## 1. LED's 
  
  i) The original.js allows us to use the LED's once they are connected to the correct pins, using the GPIO pins and ground. The video of the functioning program can be found [Here](https://imgur.com/a/BpyvbMy)

  ii) The enable-matrix.s shows the LED function in the microbit was enabled and allows the use of the LED's.

  iii) This program shows the use of the 5x5 LED array on the microbit as well as using the external LED's. The screensaver will be activated one the "A" button is pressed and will continue to repeat. The video of the screensaver and external LED's of twenty-eight.js

## 2. Soil Sensor 

  i) This program reads the TTL input from the CADET boards and only when the TTL input is a generating a high input. So when the TTL input on the CADET boards are at a 1, the LED's will turn on.

  iv) This program will use the the digital input from the Soil sensor to read function to gather data from the sensor to give us a range to use for our index.

vi) This program will get the values of each dry and wet reading from the soil sensor and get the average of both and enter them as the minimum and maximum for the new map and index for the microbit.
